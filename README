ARCHIVE
=======

What it should do
-----------------

1.  Keep a snapshot on the backup server of one or more directories on your
	local system.

2.	Keep an archive on the backup server of every file that has been removed or
    replaced in the snapshot. Or even every file in the snapshot, depending on
    the settings in your config file.
